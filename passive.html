  <h1>Passive Mobs</h2>
  <p>We discussed the monsters of Minecraft and how to survive them, but what is as equally as important are the peaceful mobs.
Killing almost any animal in Minecraft will provide you with raw meat that is able to be cooked, and food is very important in this game, as it restores health to your character, and if you have a hunger bar of 0, it will continually chip away at your health bar. Pigs will drop pork, cows beef, sheep mutton as well as wool. Wool is a block in Minecraft that can be used to make a bed; another vital tool in the game. Beds allow you to go to sleep at night time provided that you aren't in any imminent danger and skip the night, so make sure to find 2-3 sheep to kill so you can craft a bed!

  <summary>Pigs</summary>
  Pigs are common passive mobs found wandering tall grass plains and forests. They are a vital source of food for new players, dropping raw pork upon defeat.  Raw pork can be cooked in a furnace to create cooked pork, which restores a decent amount of hunger points.  Be cautious when attacking a pig, as hitting one near others will enrage the entire herd, causing them to charge at you in a defensive frenzy.

  <summary>Sheep</summary>
  Sheep are another plentiful passive mob found in grassy areas. They are most notable for their thick white fleece, which can be sheared with shears (crafted from iron ingots) to obtain wool blocks.  Wool is a critical resource for crafting a bed, an essential item that allows you to set a spawn point and skip the night entirely.  Shearing sheep will not harm them, and they will eventually regrow their wool.  If food is more pressing, eliminating sheep will grant you raw mutton.

  <summary>Cows</summary>
  Cows are docile herbivores that can be found grazing in plains and flower biomes.  They are a reliable source of food, dropping raw beef when defeated.  Raw beef can be cooked in a furnace to create cooked beef, a valuable source of nourishment for new players.  An additional benefit of encountering cows is the ability to milk them using a bucket.  Milk can be consumed to restore a small amount of hunger and can also be used to remove negative potion effects.

  <summary>Chickens</summary>
  Chickens are feathery friends that can be found in most biomes, excluding deserts and snowy areas.  These clucking companions are a source of raw chicken, which can be cooked in a furnace for food.  Chickens also occasionally lay eggs, which can be used for further food or to breed more chickens.  Eggs can be hatched by placing them in a warm sunlit location.

  <summary>Horses</summary>
  Horses are majestic passive mobs that roam plains and savannas.  Unlike other passive mobs, horses can be tamed by repeatedly mounting them until hearts appear around the horse.  Once tamed, a horse can be ridden, providing increased movement speed and protection from hostile mobs.  Horses can be equipped with saddles for increased comfort and control, and chests can be attached to store items while traveling.
