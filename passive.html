  <h1>Passive Mobs</h2>
  <p>The world of Minecraft isn't all about battling monsters and conquering the wilderness. Passive mobs add a touch of life and offer valuable resources for players who know how to interact with them. Here's a guide to befriending these creatures and maximizing the benefits they provide:</p>
<h2>Making Friends:</h2>
<p>Animals: Most passive mobs like cows, pigs, sheep, and chickens can be tamed using specific items. Cows, sheep, and mooshrooms (special cow variant) are tamed with wheat, while pigs are tamed with carrots, potatoes, or beetroots.</p>
<p>Taming Perks: Tamed animals won't wander off and can be bred to create offspring, providing a sustainable source of food or materials.</p>
<p>Leading Leashed Friends: A lead crafted from string allows you to control a tamed animal's movement, guiding them on adventures or keeping them safe near your base.</p>

<h2>Benifits of Passive Mobs:</h2>
<p>Food Source: Cows, pigs, sheep, and chickens provide a steady supply of food when hunted or bred.</p>
<p>Crafting Materials: Sheep provide wool for crafting beds, banners, and carpets. Cows offer leather for armor and books.</p>
<p>Transportation: Horses can be tamed, saddled, and ridden for faster travel across the vast landscapes of Minecraft.</p>
<p>Unique Drops: Shearing tamed Mooshrooms yields stew mushrooms, a valuable food source. Shearing sheep provides colored wool for various crafting purposes.</p>
<h2>Caring for Your Pets:</h2>
<p>Building a Pen: Construct a fenced enclosure to keep your tamed animals safe from predators and wandering off.</p>
<p>Food and Water: Provide your animal friends with easy access to food (wheat trough for cows, sheep, etc.) and a water source to keep them healthy and breeding.</p>
<p>Peaceful Coexistence: Passive mobs can create a lively atmosphere around your base. Enjoy their presence while reaping the benefits they offer!</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Remember: While passive mobs are generally friendly, avoid attacking them unless absolutely necessary. They are a valuable resource and can become loyal companions in your Minecraft adventures.</h4>

    <h4>Cow</h4>
    <p>Cows are docile herbivores that can be found grazing in plains and flower biomes.  They are a reliable source of food, dropping raw beef when defeated.  Raw beef can be cooked in a furnace to create cooked beef, a valuable source of nourishment for new players.  An additional benefit of encountering cows is the ability to milk them using a bucket.  Milk can be consumed to restore a small amount of hunger and can also be used to remove negative potion effects.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="my-item">
    <img src="pig.png" alt="pig">
    <h4>Pig</h4>
    <p>Pigs are common passive mobs found wandering tall grass plains and forests. They are a vital source of food for new players, dropping raw pork upon defeat.  Raw pork can be cooked in a furnace to create cooked pork, which restores a decent amount of hunger points.  Be cautious when attacking a pig, as hitting one near others will enrage the entire herd, causing them to charge at you in a defensive frenzy.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="my-item">
    <img src="chicken.png" alt="chicken">
    <h4>Chicken</h4>
    <p>Chickens are feathery friends that can be found in most biomes, excluding deserts and snowy areas.  These clucking companions are a source of raw chicken, which can be cooked in a furnace for food.  Chickens also occasionally lay eggs, which can be used for further food or to breed more chickens.  Eggs can be hatched by placing them in a warm sunlit location.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="my-item">
    <img src="passive.png" alt="sheep">
    <h4>Sheep</h4>
    <p>Sheep are another plentiful passive mob found in grassy areas. They are most notable for their thick white fleece, which can be sheared with shears (crafted from iron ingots) to obtain wool blocks.  Wool is a critical resource for crafting a bed, an essential item that allows you to set a spawn point and skip the night entirely.  Shearing sheep will not harm them, and they will eventually regrow their wool.  If food is more pressing, eliminating sheep will grant you raw mutton.</p>

  <div class="my-item">
    <img src="horse.png" alt="horse">
    <h4>Horse</h4>
    <p>Horses are majestic passive mobs that roam plains and savannas.  Unlike other passive mobs, horses can be tamed by repeatedly mounting them until hearts appear around the horse.  Once tamed, a horse can be ridden, providing increased movement speed and protection from hostile mobs.  Horses can be equipped with saddles for increased comfort and control, and chests can be attached to store items while traveling.</p>
