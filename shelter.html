  <h1>Shelter</h2>
  <p>Housing in Minecraft can be as temporary or as permanent as you want it to be- what's important is that you like where it's located and how it looks, but in it's most innate purpose, a 'house' in Minecraft is meant to keep the monsters out. Using the blocks you have acquired, you can create shelter to look however you want, but the most important part is that your house has 3 elements: Walls, floor, and a roof. The dimensions don't hold too much importance as this is a user-preference- it can be as small or as grand as you like. While a bed is optional, it makes the night go by much faster, so you will want to make sure you are able to sleep as you are not able to when there are aggressive mobs too close by. If you're still worried about your safety- never fear! A great accessory to a house are torches. They simultaneously provide light to locate your house if you are far away, improve visibility as well as ward off the aggressive mobs! So if you want to be unbothered during the night, put torches around the perimeter of your house- that way, you are less likely to receive groans and skeletons at your front step.

  <summary>House</summary>
A house is your primary refuge in Minecraft, providing shelter from the elements and hostile mobs.  A basic house can be constructed from any readily available blocks like dirt, cobblestone, or wood.  As you progress, you can incorporate more complex designs and materials.  Remember to include essential elements like walls, a roof, a crafting table, and a furnace for cooking food and smelting ores.

<details>
  <summary>Crafting Area</summary>
A dedicated crafting area streamlines your workflow and keeps your essential crafting supplies organized.  This area should include a crafting table, chests to store crafting materials and tools, and an anvil for repairing equipment.  You can incorporate torches for illumination and decorate the space to your liking.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Enchantment Area</summary>
An enchantment area allows you to enhance your tools, weapons, and armor with powerful enchantments.  To create this area, you'll need to build enchanting tables and bookshelves.  Enchanting requires lapis lazuli, a rare resource found underground, so plan accordingly.  Enchanted gear can give you advantages like increased damage output, mining speed, or defensive capabilities.

  <summary>Blacksmith</summary>
A blacksmith shop is a dedicated space for crafting and storing tools and armor.  This build typically incorporates furnaces for smelting ores, anvils for repairing equipment, and crafting tables for creating tools and armor.  Chests can be used to store your crafted gear and materials.  You can design your blacksmith shop with a rustic theme using materials like cobblestone, wood, and iron blocks.

  <summary>Castle</summary>
Castles are grand defensive structures showcasing your wealth and resources.  Constructed from sturdy materials like cobblestone and stone bricks, castles feature thick walls, towers, and a main keep.  You can incorporate hidden passages, moats, drawbridges, and elaborate fortifications to deter invaders.  Castles can be quite resource-intensive, so be prepared to gather a significant amount of materials before embarking on this ambitious build.

  <summary>Mine</summary>
Mines are essential for gathering valuable resources found deep underground.  There are two main approaches to mining: strip mining and cave exploration.  Strip mining involves digging long horizontal tunnels at specific depths to expose ore veins.  Cave exploration involves venturing into natural cave systems, which can be more dangerous but also yield greater rewards.  Always bring torches for illumination, sturdy picks for mining, and enough food to sustain yourself during your expeditions.
