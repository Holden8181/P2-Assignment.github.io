  <h1>Aggressive Mobs</h2>
  <p>The world of Minecraft isn't all sunshine and friendly cows. As the day fades and shadows lengthen, a different breed of creature awakens. These are the aggressive mobs â€“ dangerous denizens of the night (and sometimes even the day!) that will attack players on sight.

    These hostile mobs come in a frightening variety. Some skulk in the darkness, their glowing eyes betraying their presence. Others roam the open world, a constant threat on the horizon.  Each type of aggressive mob presents its own unique challenge.</p>
  <details>
  <summary>Zombie</summary>
  Perhaps the slowest moving mob, Zombies are identified by their groan. Also weak to sunlight, the best course of action is to hit the zombie then back up, as it is quite slow.

<details>
  <summary>Spider</summary>
  Spiders are relatively fast monsters, with glowing red eyes, so be careful not to mistake their eyes for apples in a tree. They can also place webs, which if you make the mistake in stepping in, you will be slowed greatly. To kill this mob, simply keep hitting it, as they are relatively weak.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Enderman</summary>
  The Enderman is a tall, slim black mob with purple eyes and purple particles that appear around it, and they are known for stealing blocks. It is quite difficult to harm them, as when you attempt to hit with any means they will teleport away from you. Don't stare into their eyes, however; doing this will enrage them and cause them to chase you down. If you do make this mistake, your best bet is to find the nearest body of water and jump in it, as doing this will break their aggression.

<details>
  <summary>Skeleton</summary>
  Skeletons are mobs armed with bows and arrows who will attempt to shoot you once you have come close enough to them to aggravate them. Dodging their shots is easy enough, just simply move in a zigzag pattern or unpredictable fashion to avoid their hits. They are able to be taken down by hitting them enough times, and killing them can result in the drop of bones or even a bow! They are also weak to sunlight, so if you find one while it's daytime, try to bait it into the light, which will cause it to burst into flames and eventually die.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Creeper</summary>
  Creepers are a mob identified by the shades of green around their body, as well as their four short legs which are relatively close to the ground. When you come too close to one, a creeper will combust, dealing significant damage to you as well as the environment around you. Your best bet when it comes to creepers is hitting it then enough distance so that it doesn't self-destruct, repeating this process until they are dead. You are able to tell when a creeper is about to do this when they start pulsing white.
