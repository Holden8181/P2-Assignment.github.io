  <h1>Aggressive Mobs</h2>
  <p>The world of Minecraft isn't all sunshine and friendly cows. As the day fades and shadows lengthen, a different breed of creature awakens. These are the aggressive mobs â€“ dangerous denizens of the night (and sometimes even the day!) that will attack players on sight. These hostile mobs come in a frightening variety. Some skulk in the darkness, their glowing eyes betraying their presence. Others roam the open world, a constant threat on the horizon.  Each type of aggressive mob presents its own unique challenge.</p>
 <h2>Strategys for Aggressive Mobs</h2>
<p>1. Light Up Your World:  Mobs spawn less frequently in well-lit areas. Torches, glowstone, and lanterns are your allies in keeping the darkness at bay.</p>
<p>2. The Art of Combat:  Learn to "strafe" (move side-to-side) while fighting to avoid enemy attacks. Time your attacks carefully to maximize damage dealt.</p>
<p>3. Don't Be Afraid to Run!:  If facing overwhelming odds, strategic retreat can save your life. Regroup, prepare yourself, and return to the fight on your terms.</p>
<p>4. Taming the Beast:  While some mobs are purely hostile, others can be tamed or befriended. Wolves can be tamed into loyal companions who fight alongside you.</p>
<h4>With courage, preparation, and a bit of know-how, you'll be conquering the night and mastering the art of monster slaying in Minecraft!</h4>

  <div class="my-item">
    <img src="zombie.png" alt="zombie">
    <h4>Zombie</h4>
    <p>Minecraft's iconic foe, the zombie, shambles forth at night with a hunger for brains... yours!  Their green, decaying skin and moans announce their arrival. Don't underestimate their slow swipes - a group can overwhelm even prepared players.  By day, sunlight burns these mindless mobs, offering a temporary respite.  Craft some armor, grab a sword, and keep those torches lit to outlast the night and survive the relentless zombie threat.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="my-item">
    <img src="spider.png" alt="spider">
    <h4>Spider</h4>
    <p>Spiders are relatively fast monsters, with glowing red eyes, so be careful not to mistake their eyes for apples in a tree. They can also place webs, which if you make the mistake in stepping in, you will be slowed greatly. To kill this mob, simply keep hitting it, as they are relatively weak.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="my-item">
    <img src="enderman.png" alt="enderman">
    <h4>Enderman</h4>
    <p>The Enderman is a tall, slim black mob with purple eyes and purple particles that appear around it, and they are known for stealing blocks. It is quite difficult to harm them, as when you attempt to hit with any means they will teleport away from you. Don't stare into their eyes, however; doing this will enrage them and cause them to chase you down. If you do make this mistake, your best bet is to find the nearest body of water and jump in it, as doing this will break their aggression.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="my-item">
    <img src="skeleton.png" alt="Skeleton">
    <h4>Skeleton</h4>
    <p>Skeletons are mobs armed with bows and arrows who will attempt to shoot you once you have come close enough to them to aggravate them. Dodging their shots is easy enough, just simply move in a zigzag pattern or unpredictable fashion to avoid their hits. They are able to be taken down by hitting them enough times, and killing them can result in the drop of bones or even a bow! They are also weak to sunlight, so if you find one while it's daytime, try to bait it into the light, which will cause it to burst into flames and eventually die.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="my-item">
    <img src="creeper.png" alt="creeper">
    <h4>Creeper</h4>
    <p>Creepers are a mob identified by the shades of green around their body, as well as their four short legs which are relatively close to the ground. When you come too close to one, a creeper will combust, dealing significant damage to you as well as the environment around you. Your best bet when it comes to creepers is hitting it then enough distance so that it doesn't self-destruct, repeating this process until they are dead. You are able to tell when a creeper is about to do this when they start pulsing white.</p>
