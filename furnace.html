  <h1>Smelting</h1>
  <p>Smelting is a fundamental process in Minecraft, allowing you to transform raw materials like ores into usable ingots, tools, and other valuable items. This guide will equip you with the knowledge to become a master smelter and unlock the true potential of your Minecraft resources!</p>
<h2>Needed Resources:</h2>
<p>Fuel Source: You'll need a fuel source to power the furnace. Common fuel sources include coal, charcoal, wood planks, and even lava buckets (lava provides the most efficient fuel).</p>
<p>Furnace: The furnace is where the magic happens! You can craft a furnace using eight cobblestones arranged in a square pattern in the crafting grid. Alternatively, you might find furnaces in villages blacksmith chests.</p>
<h2>The Smelting Process:</h2>
<p>1. Open the Furnace Interface:  Right-click on the furnace you've placed on the ground. This will open the furnace interface, displaying a 3x3 crafting grid on top and a fuel slot below.</p>
<p>2. Fueling the Furnace:  Drag and drop your chosen fuel source (coal, wood planks, etc.) into the fuel slot at the bottom of the furnace interface.</p>
<p>3. Adding Ores to Smelt:  Drag and drop the raw materials you wish to smelt (ores, sand, etc.) into the top crafting grid of the furnace interface. You can add up to one stack of items (64 items) per slot.</p>
<p>4. Smelting Progress: As the fuel burns, a progress bar will indicate the smelting process. The time it takes to smelt an item depends on the fuel source used and the item being smelted.</p>
<p>5. Collecting Smelted Items: Once the progress bar is complete, the smelted item will appear in the output slot on the right side of the furnace interface. Click on the output slot to transfer the smelted item(s) to your inventory.</p>


<h2>Items to Smelt:</h2>  <div class="craft-item"></div>
<div class="my-list">
  
  <div class="my-item">
    <img src="iron.png" alt="Iron">
    <h4>Iron</h4>
    <p>Iron is a valuable resource obtained by smelting iron ore in a furnace.  Iron ore is a reddish-brown block found deep underground.  Smelting one iron ore will yield one iron ingot.  Iron ingots are used to craft a vast array of tools, armor, and weaponry, making them essential for progression.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="my-item">
    <img src="gold.png" alt="gold">
    <h4>Gold</h4>
    <p>Gold ore, a bright yellow block found underground, can be smelted in a furnace to create gold ingots.  While not as durable as iron, gold ingots have their uses.  They can be crafted into tools and armor, though these golden implements are more for show than practicality due to their lower durability.  Gold is also a valuable trading commodity with villagers.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="my-item">
    <img src="food.png" alt="food">
    <h4>Food</h4>
    <p>Most raw meat obtained from passive mobs can be cooked in a furnace to create cooked food.  Raw pork, beef, mutton, and chicken can all be transformed into their cooked counterparts, which restore more hunger points than their raw versions.  Cooking meat also eliminates the risk of food poisoning from consuming raw meat.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="my-item">
    <img src="charcoal.png" alt="charcoal">
    <h4>Charcoal</h4>
    <p>Charcoal is a versatile fuel source for your furnace.  It can be obtained by smelting wood logs in a furnace.  While wood logs can be used as fuel, charcoal burns for much longer, making it a more efficient fuel source.  Charcoal can also be used to craft torches for nighttime illumination.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="my-item">
    <img src="glass.png" alt="glass">
    <h4>Glass</h4>
    <p>Glass, a transparent block used for windows and decorative purposes, can be crafted by smelting sand in a furnace.  Sand is a readily available resource found in deserts and on beaches.  Smelting sand will transform it into glass blocks, which can be arranged to create windows, allowing natural light to illuminate your builds.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="my-item">
    <img src="stone.png" alt="stone">
    <h4>Stone</h4>
    <p>Stone, a fundamental building block, can actually be obtained by smelting cobblestone in a furnace.  Cobblestone is a gray block commonly found near bodies of water and underground.  Smelting one cobblestone will yield one smooth stone block.  While both cobblestone and smooth stone can be used for building, smooth stone offers a more polished aesthetic.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="my-item">
    <img src="brick.png" alt="brick">
    <h4>Brick</h4>
    <p>Bricks, used for a more aesthetically pleasing and fire-resistant alternative to cobblestone, are not directly smelted in a furnace.  Instead, clay blocks, found near water bodies, can be molded into clay balls and then baked in a furnace to create bricks.  Bricks can then be used for crafting and construction purposes.</p>
