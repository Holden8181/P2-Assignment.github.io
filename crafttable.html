  <h1>Craft Table</h2>
  <p>Once your crafting table is made, you will want to break down the wood from the trees into a combination of sticks and wood blocks. Every block of tree wood equates to 4 blocks of wood material. Using this, you will want to create wooden tools, such as pickaxes, axes, and shovels, which allow you to mine stone materials. While you can mine stone materials without wood tools, it takes much longer to do! Mining stone allows you to move up on the material tier list, and therefore mine more durable and efficient tools.


Now you should have accrued not only stone tools, but a sufficient amount of stone blocks as well. Make sure you are going back to your crafting table to create these!

  <summary>Bed</summary>
A Bed, crafted from three wool blocks and three wooden planks, is a vital item for setting a spawn point and sleeping through the night.  Simply place the bed down and right-click to set your spawn point.  When night falls, cuddling up in bed will skip the night entirely, allowing you to wake up refreshed in the morning.  Be sure to place your bed in a safe location, as waking up in danger negates the benefit of a good night's sleep.
