  <h1>Mobs</h2>
  <p>Mobs in Minecraft include the monsters that go bump in the night, the cows that keep your belly full, and so much more! Some mobs in Minecraft have a purpose that isn't limited to attempting to kill you or providing food, and a great example of this are villagers. Villagers can be found around the world in Minecraft, in which they will typically be found at a village made of wooden houses. If you are feeling lucky, you are able to go inside their houses and find valuable supplies such as food, building blocks or materials for armor. As well as looting their houses, you are able to trade with them. There is an element in Minecraft known as emeralds, which may appear to be useless at first as you cannot create armor out of it. Finding these villagers with sufficient emeralds allows you to trade for items that can help you to go to different realms in the world of Minecraft! Click "Passsive" or "Aggressive" at the top left to learn about the different types of mobs.</p>
