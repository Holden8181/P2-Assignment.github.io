  <h1>Minecraft First Night Survival</h2>
  <p>A run-down on how to survive with crafting and mobs in Minecraft</p>
  <p>Minecraft is a free-roam survival game with a lot to explore, but our topic is getting through the first night.</p>
  <h2>Setting</h2>
  <p>As monsters arrive in Minecraft as the night falls, you'll want to be prepared before then; the first step is gathering supplies. There's a sort of tier list in Minecraft of materials, meaning some are better than others, but it requires more work to acquire as you move up the list. The very first thing you'll want to do is find an area where you wish to set up a base for the night, preferably around trees. Trees are important in Minecraft because they allow you to farm wood, the first material in the tier-list, meaning it is the easier to get. After finding an area sufficient to you, you will want to break down some trees which you can do with bare hands. After you have a good amount of wood blocks, around 12 or so, you will want to open your inventory by pressing I on your keyboard. From there, you will be able to make a crafting table.</p>
